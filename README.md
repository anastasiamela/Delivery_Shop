# Delivery_Shop

The back-end of an online delivery application that allows guest users to view items, add them to their shopping cart, checkout & create orders.

The online delivery shop (e.g. Restaurant, Fast Food) has a menu that consists of 5 categories and each category consists of products. 

The stored price of each item is in Euro, but the API supports more currencies. For the currency conversions is used a public API (http://fixer.io). 
The payment method is cash only. 

The delivery address is required in order to create an order. 

The merchant is able to view the incoming orders.
